Description
======== 

This plugin was designed for the purpose of outputting the meta data associated with a WP post or page so developers and site designers can verify what information is available.

To use this plugin, simply activate then either simply navigate to a post, page or custom post type and then click on the "DPM" link in the toolbar. For those who have the toolbar disabled, setting ```bash show_meta=true``` in the URL will activate the meta display. Here's an [example](http://example.com/test-post/?show_meta=true)
